# Survey instruments

Original HERI survey instruments used to collect the freshmen (2000) and senior (2004) cohorts.

- `2000FreshmenSurvey_instrument.pdf` — Questionnaire administered to the entering cohort.
- `2004SeniorSurvey_instrument.pdf` — Follow-up questionnaire administered to the same cohort at graduation.

Keep these PDFs alongside the codebooks so analysts can trace question text back to the indicators in the data files.

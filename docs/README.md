# 6ixPacDataFinal – STAT 520 Final Project Repository

This repository contains the full workflow for the STAT 520 project, including data management, exploratory analysis, factor analysis, structural modeling, visualizations, and the final report materials. The goal of this organization is to make the project accessible for beginners while supporting advanced reproducible statistical analysis.

## Folder focus: `docs/`

Central reference materials live here—codebooks, survey instruments, SAS program summaries, and any narrative documentation that supports the analysis.

### Key contents
- `Codebooks/` for official HERI variable definitions and encoding.
- `Survey_Instruments/` for the questionnaires administered to each cohort.
- `sas_output/` and other reference notes that explain the lineage of the raw data.

### Usage guidelines
- Treat this directory as read-only: do not modify vendor-provided PDFs.
- When new documentation arrives, place it in the appropriate subfolder and update the subfolder README.
- Reference these artifacts from analysis notebooks so readers can trace indicators back to the original wording.

# 6ixPacDataFinal – STAT 520 Final Project Repository

This repository contains the full workflow for the STAT 520 project, including data management, exploratory analysis, factor analysis, structural modeling, visualizations, and the final report materials. The goal of this organization is to make the project accessible for beginners while supporting advanced reproducible statistical analysis.

## Folder focus: `reports/`

Draft narratives, final write-ups, presentation decks, and supporting figures are stored here so communications stay in sync with the analytical outputs.

### Key contents
- Drafts of the STAT 520 paper and slide decks.
- Final report artifacts, including appendices and interpretation memos.
- `Figures/` subfolder that holds exported graphics referenced across deliverables.

### Usage guidelines
- Keep a changelog within each document or in commit messages when major interpretation updates occur.
- Promote figures from `results/` only after verifying they are final; keep intermediate plots in `results/`.
- Store only narrative deliverables here—source code belongs under `src/`.

# 6ixPacDataFinal – STAT 520 Final Project Repository

This repository contains the full workflow for the STAT 520 project, including data management, exploratory analysis, factor analysis, structural modeling, visualizations, and the final report materials. The goal of this organization is to make the project accessible for beginners while supporting advanced reproducible statistical analysis.

## Folder focus: `reports/Figures`

Finalized graphics, tables, and exported visuals that appear in reports or presentations are staged here after they pass QA in `results/`.

### Key contents
- Publication-ready PDFs/PNGs of CFA and SEM diagrams.
- Tables referenced in the narrative (e.g., fit statistics, variable descriptions).
- Slides-ready assets synced with the final deliverables.

### Usage guidelines
- Keep filenames descriptive and versioned (e.g., `cfa_path_diagram_v2.pdf`).
- Note the source script/notebook in a sidecar `.txt` or within `reports/README.md` when a figure updates.
- Retire superseded figures to an `archive/` subfolder rather than deleting them, preserving provenance.

6ixPacDataFinal – STAT 520 Final Project Repository

This repository contains the full workflow for the STAT 520 project, including data management, exploratory analysis, factor analysis, structural modeling, visualizations, and the final report materials. 
Folder focus: `src/py`

Python scripts power data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine-learning experiments that complement the R-based factor modeling.

Key contents
- Data processing modules that output the `data/clean/` files.
- Notebook-friendly utilities for visualization and descriptive statistics.
- Experimental ML pipelines stored as scripts or notebooks that write to `results/`.
